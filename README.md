Advent of Code 2016
===================

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016).


With PyTest
===================
To quick check most tests use:
~~~~
pytest
~~~~
To see slightly more detailed results:
~~~~
pytest -v
~~~~
To include tests with completion time more than 
a couple of seconds and future test templates, use:
~~~~
pytest --ignored
~~~~
